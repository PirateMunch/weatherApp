Odin Project - WeatherApp.

My main task is to learn how to use API's and build a weather App. 
The user should be able to enter any location and get information back on that location.  A toggle to view in Celcius or Fahrenhiet. A visual indicator of the weather (pic/background change to reflect weather)
